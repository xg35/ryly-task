## Original User Request:
Ok, I want to make an app name Ryly

for tracking food and service orders at a hotel.

The users are hotel staffs, they have an app that has geo location turned on.

In their dashboard, they see a list of task; OPEN, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED

Within each ticket is a description, room_no and name of the requestor

They can click on an item and open it; from there they can see the details of it; which is typically a request description. They can then click on accept and the next thing they can do is mark as complete.

Once they are done the task they can do the next one. A person may accept more or more task; so they should be able to go back see all the task they have accepted.

The app needs to store the tickets in a database and read from it. There will be multiple user and when a person mark it in progress it assigns it to them.
